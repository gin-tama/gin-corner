Recently, I am thinking, as developer, there are a lot of thing happened, and too many thing need to  remember. It is hard to just keep it by a brain only.

My motto is "don't make the same mistake twice". 

Therefore, I want to test out the plan that write "Today Lesson Learn" every day. 

Maybe after a while, every 1 or 2 months, review the "Learnt" and properly filing/tags in more structural way.
